### Warning
* These programs are written based on the 3.7.4 version of the Python language, and maybe some writing is difficult for users of Python 3.8 to understand.<br>
* When I was designing, the data structure of some programs was not well designed, which made cleaning very troublesome.<br>
* When running, some programs are not efficient and waste memory.
